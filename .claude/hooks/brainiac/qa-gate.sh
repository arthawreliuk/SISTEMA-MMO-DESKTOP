# Brainiac Context — QA Gate hook (Stop, soft/warning)
# If context/evolution/buglog.md was Edit/Write in this session AND the new
# entry appears to lack a test reference, surface a warning (non-blocking).
#
# This is a SOFT hook. It outputs a systemMessage via JSON on stdout with
# exit 0 — Claude sees it as a user-visible warning but is NOT blocked.
#
# Rule enforced (from agent-qa.md): Rule 1 — every bugfix L1+ must produce a
# regression test OR include an explicit test-infeasibility note.
#
# Detection heuristic: the buglog entry must mention at least one of:
#   Validation, test, spec, Playwright, Vitest, Jest, pytest, e2e, unit,
#   regression, infeasibility
#
# False positives are possible (e.g., the word "test" in an unrelated
# sentence). This hook is advisory — the human decides whether to act.
